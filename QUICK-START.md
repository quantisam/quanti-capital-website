## 🆘 Stuck? Common Issues

### "I don't have GitHub"
→ Takes 2 minutes to create account at github.com

### "Upload failed"
→ Make sure you're uploading ALL files including hidden ones (.gitignore)

### "Build failed on Vercel"
→ Check that package.json uploaded correctly

### "Domain not working"
→ DNS takes time (15 min - 48 hours). Check `.vercel.app` URL first

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test first:** Visit your `.vercel.app` URL before connecting domain
2. **Bookmark Vercel:** You'll use it to see analytics and make updates
3. **Keep GitHub open:** Every time you update GitHub, Vercel auto-deploys
4. **Mobile test:** Check on your phone - it's fully responsive
